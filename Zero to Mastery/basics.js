// This is a refresher of the basics of JavaScript from Zero to Mastery next is intermediate  then we are looking at advanced concepts

//like many  programming lanugages there are TYPES

//number
3+4
3*4
3/4
3-4
(20-5) * 15
12 % 4 //this will give you the remainder so since 12 divided by 4 is 3 with no remainder the answer would be 0.

//string
"This is a string."
'This is also a string.'
"Hello" + " " + "there"
//if you try to add text to string it wont add in a traditional sense of the word
10 + "35" // this would give you 1035 instead of 45 like you might assume it would. it converst by itself the 10 to a string
10 - "35" //will solve it because a minus is not related to strings it is only related to numbers it will change the 35 to number
//best to keep actions involving types of the same kind 

//boolean
true
false
//boolean has only two answers it is either true or false , 1 or 0  on or off. 
3 > 2 // would give us back true as 3 is larger than 2.

//undefinded

//null

//symbol 

//object


//We also have COMPARISINS that you will see in many languages 

//!==

//===

//<=

//>=

//<

//>


// We also have VARIABLES that we can call
var cat = 2 
// we can also turn a string into a number say
var dog = two
Number(dog)
//this is particularily usefull when taking user input.

//let

//const

//JavaScript CONDITIONALS

//if

//else 

//else if

//ternary operator

//switch

//LOGICAL OPERATORS

//&&

//||

// !

//FUNCTIONS

//var a = function name() {}

// function name() {}

//return

// () =>


//DATA STRUCTURES

//Array

// Object
